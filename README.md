## About This Repository

This repository contains source files only and is intended for transparency purposes. It does not include the Fabric wrapper, so you cannot compile the mod directly from here.

To compile the mod yourself, download the [Fabric mod template](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod), copy these source files over, and build from there. No support is provided for this process.
